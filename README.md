# hello-world

Hello Everyone!

I'm new here and fairly new to coding! I'm pretty darn excited to be here! (thus all the exclamation points haha). I'm currently learning more about html,css,javascript and python. I'm really trying to build a good foundation in coding and look forward to working with the community! Have an awesome day!
